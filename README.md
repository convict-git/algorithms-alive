**This repository is planned to contain the implementations of approximation
algorithms with visualizations**.

## Planning:

- For a problem, there must be two visualizations:

      - one using a approximation based algorithm and,
      - other using naive bruteforce (neat backtracks with pruinings).

- Plan is to have the C++ back-end for processing and Python a front-end (most
    probably pygame).

- The C++ back-end will contain the implementations in such a way that, these
    libraries can be used as a black box from pygame.

 - Use a build system, proper open-source hygienes such as good variable naming,
     informative but small commits, code reviews and use of issue tracker. Have
     a design documenation ready before the implementation and get the design
     reviewed by the collaborators.

- If you are interesting in contributing,
    mail to `official.mr.convict [at] gmail [dot] com`
